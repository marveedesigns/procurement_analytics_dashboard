# Procurement Process Optimization using Data Analytics

This project applies data analytics and machine learning to analyze procurement efficiency
and predict potential delays in the approval cycle.

### Objectives
- Explore patterns in vendor reliability and approval time.
- Build a regression model to forecast procurement delays.
- Design an interactive dashboard for decision-makers.

### Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, Power BI, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

### Key Results
- Built a predictive model for delay forecasting.
- Identified key factors influencing vendor performance.
- Created a sample Power BI dashboard visualizing KPIs.

See src/ for scripts and data/ for the simulated dataset.
Run `python main.py` to execute the data analysis, model training, and visualization.
